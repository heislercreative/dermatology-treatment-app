# Dermatology Treatment App

This Sinatra MVC app allows dermatologists to track their patients' conditions, with an easy patient list view indicating who still requires treatment.

## Installation & Usage

To start using the app, clone the repository, run `bundle` to install all necessary gems, `rake db:migrate` to create the database tables, and `shotgun` to launch the web server. Navigate to the shotgun url to view the index page.

- Sign up to create a new provider
- Once logged in, providers can create and manage their patients.
- Each patient can have a list of conditions with details including diagnosis and treatment dates.
- Both patients and their conditions can be edited and/or deleted.
